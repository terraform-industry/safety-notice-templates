🚨 **DAC Team | Shade Structure Fabrication | WELDING HAZARD | Start: Wed, June 11 5:30 PM PST | End: Until Further Notice** 🚨

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE ⚠️

**SHADE STRUCTURE BASE WELDING OPERATIONS IN PROGRESS**  
**From: June 11, 2025 5:30 PM PST - Until: FURTHER NOTICE**  

**NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN!**

Welding operations will be conducted in DAC Bay using Arc/MIG welding equipment.

## 🔥 POTENTIAL HAZARDS

### WELDING ARC HAZARDS
- Intense UV and IR radiation causing arc eye/flash burns
- Visible light hazards requiring proper eye protection
- Arc radiation can burn exposed skin
- Arc flash risk during electrical welding

### FIRE AND EXPLOSION RISKS
- Sparks and molten metal spray up to **10 meters**
- Hot workpieces remain fire hazards after welding
- Flammable materials must be removed from work area
- Compressed gas cylinders present explosion risk

### TOXIC FUMES AND GASES
- Metal fumes (zinc, lead, chromium, nickel) based on materials
- Shielding gas displacement of oxygen
- Phosgene gas formation if chlorinated solvents present
- Nitrogen dioxide and ozone formation

### ELECTRICAL HAZARDS (Electric Arc Welding)
- Electric shock from welding equipment
- Secondary voltage shock hazards
- Wet conditions increase electrocution risk

### ADDITIONAL RISKS
- Hot metal burns from workpieces
- Compressed gas cylinder hazards
- Noise exposure exceeding 85 dB

## 🛡️ SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY PPE
- **Welding helmet** with appropriate shade #10-13
- **Fire-resistant clothing** (no synthetic materials)
- **Welding gloves** - leather or appropriate material
- **Safety glasses** under welding helmet
- **Steel-toed boots** with metatarsal guards
- **Respiratory protection** if ventilation inadequate

### WORK AREA REQUIREMENTS
- Maintain **10-meter fire watch perimeter**
- Fire extinguisher within **3 meters** of work area
- Welding screens/curtains to protect others from arc
- Remove all flammables within **10 meters**
- Adequate ventilation or fume extraction
- Fire watch maintained for **30 minutes** after completion

### SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
- Hot work permit required: YES
- Confined space procedures if applicable
- Lock-out/tag-out for equipment maintenance
- Gas cylinder safety protocols in effect
