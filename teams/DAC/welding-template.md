## ‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**[PROJECT/EQUIPMENT NAME] WELDING OPERATIONS IN PROGRESS**  
**From: [START DATE/TIME] - Until: [END DATE/TIME OR "FURTHER NOTICE"]**  
**[OPTIONAL PROJECT TAGLINE/DESCRIPTION]**  

**NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN!**

Welding operations will be conducted in [LOCATION] using [WELDING TYPE - e.g., TIG, MIG, Arc, Oxy-acetylene].

## üî• POTENTIAL HAZARDS

### WELDING ARC HAZARDS
- Intense UV and IR radiation causing arc eye/flash burns
- Visible light hazards requiring proper eye protection
- Arc radiation can burn exposed skin
- Arc flash risk during electrical welding

### FIRE AND EXPLOSION RISKS
- Sparks and molten metal spray up to **[X] meters**
- Hot workpieces remain fire hazards after welding
- Flammable materials must be removed from work area
- Compressed gas cylinders present explosion risk

### TOXIC FUMES AND GASES
- Metal fumes (zinc, lead, chromium, nickel) based on materials
- Shielding gas displacement of oxygen
- Phosgene gas formation if chlorinated solvents present
- Nitrogen dioxide and ozone formation

### ELECTRICAL HAZARDS (Electric Arc Welding)
- Electric shock from welding equipment
- Secondary voltage shock hazards
- Wet conditions increase electrocution risk

### ADDITIONAL RISKS
- Hot metal burns from workpieces
- Compressed gas cylinder hazards
- Noise exposure exceeding 85 dB
- [ADDITIONAL PROJECT-SPECIFIC RISKS]

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY PPE
- **Welding helmet** with appropriate shade # [SPECIFY SHADE]
- **Fire-resistant clothing** (no synthetic materials)
- **Welding gloves** - leather or appropriate material
- **Safety glasses** under welding helmet
- **Steel-toed boots** with metatarsal guards
- **Respiratory protection** if ventilation inadequate

### WORK AREA REQUIREMENTS
- Maintain **[X]-meter fire watch perimeter**
- Fire extinguisher within **3 meters** of work area
- Welding screens/curtains to protect others from arc
- Remove all flammables within **10 meters**
- Adequate ventilation or fume extraction
- Fire watch maintained for **30 minutes** after completion

### SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
- Hot work permit required: [YES/NO]
- Confined space procedures if applicable
- Lock-out/tag-out for equipment maintenance
- Gas cylinder safety protocols in effect
- [ADDITIONAL PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]

## üìû SAFETY & RESPONSIBLE PARTY CONTACTS

**Site Safety Officer**: [NAME] @[CONTACT]  
**Certified Welder/Operator**: [NAME] @[CONTACT]  
**Fire Watch Personnel**: [NAME] @[CONTACT]  
**[ADDITIONAL ROLES]**: [NAME] @[CONTACT]  

**In a perceived emergency scenario, do not wait to dial 911**

## üöí EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

1. **Fire**: Use appropriate extinguisher (Class D for metal fires)
2. **Arc flash injury**: Do not look at flash, seek immediate medical attention
3. **Burns**: Cool with water, do not remove clothing stuck to skin
4. **Gas leak**: Evacuate area, shut off at cylinder if safe

Welding operations will continue until further notice. All personnel must comply with posted safety boundaries and hot work protocols.
